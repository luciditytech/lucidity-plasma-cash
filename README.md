# Lucidity Plasma Cash :collision:

PoC implementation of Plasma Cash. 
Smart contract is written in Solidity for Ethereum. 
Sidechain functionality (plasma user and operator) is written in Javascript.

## Overview

This implementation of plasma cash is a bit different from general specification/guidelines.  
 Main differences:
 - it treats each deposit as individual tree/chain.
 - exits are stored in matrix, where keys are `depositId` and `blockIndex`
   so each exit has its own place.
 - every deposit has its own exit queue
 - priority is not based on exit time, but based on block index
 - challenges uses single transaction instead of two (current and previous)
 - there is no need to reply to challenge
 - you need to finalize exits for each deposit separately

The implementation was tested against below scenarios and all test are done with success:
  * exits on deposit scenario
  * spend scenario
  * double spent scenario
  * invalid block scenario
  * withheld block scenario

## Install

To run this, you will need on your machine: 
- nodejs
- truffle
- ganache-cli

then:

```
$ npm install
$ git hf init
```

## Run tests

**Warning** - there are around 135 tests. 
Tests include delay that is needed for challenge time. 
Because of that, they will take some time - up to several minutes.  
Depend on how fast is your machine, there might be a need to adjust delay time.
Test error message will let you know if you need to set higher delay time or not.
You can do it in `./test/helpers/createScenarioObjects.js`, 
find `challengeTimeoutSec` variable and set valid time.

You can choose different tests to run:

* `truffle test` or `npm run test`
* check for linters errors: `npm run lint`
* With code coverage: `npm run coverage` - 
**IMPORTANT**: turn off local RPC client before run this test.  
Coverage results:
![coverage test results](./coverage-tests.png "coverage test results")

### Issues during tests

* `Error: ENOENT: no such file or directory, open './allFiredEvents'`

If you experience above issue during coverage test, then create file 
`touch ./allFiredEvents` each time before you run test command, it should help.

### Test results

Here you can see results and path for main tests scenarios for plasma cash:

* exits on deposit scenario
![deposit scenario](./scenario-deposits.png)
* spend scenario
![spent scenario](./scenario-spent.png)
* double spent scenario
![double spent scenario](./scenario-double-spent.png)
* invalid block scenario 
![invalid block scenario](./scenario-invalid-history.png)
* withheld block scenario
![withheld block scenario](./scenario-withheld-block.png)
  
You can find files with this tests in `test/scenarios/` directory.

### TODO

- test multiple tx for single submit block
- optimize SparseMerkleTree:  
ie. if we have deposits for #3, #9, #20, then not create merkle tree for all slots, 
instead just for #3..#21.
- make exit bond to be maximum of (exit bond, deposit amount)?
- test if we could optimize storage for history of transactions ie: 
resign from storing empty blocks (where no tx on our deposit was made)
- maybe add max number of exits at one time, 
when finalizing or stop after first valid one?
- add support for tokens (`_currency`)
- try to simplify implementation 
by removing signature/spender check in plasma contract
- test it against invalid `targetBlock`
